# ml-project-diabetes-prediction
This is a Machine learning based project which predicts whether the person is having diabetes or not. Along with my team members I created this project for our inhouse internship which was offered by our college.

ABOUT OUR PROJECT:
1. We took the data set from google and we performed data preprocessing.
2. After that, we divided the data into two groups: training and testing.
3. We calculated the accuracy slope of the testing data,.
4. We used  support vector machine classifier to predict whether or not the person has diabetes.
5. We did not create an interface model; instead, we created a predictive model that predicts whether or not a person has diabetes after inputting  the data.

Pregnancies,Glucose,BloodPressure,SkinThickness,Insulin,BMI,DiabetesPedigreeFunction,Age are the 8 parameters that have been taken to measure the diabetes.

In this project we have used Support Vector Machine Algorithm.
Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.
We have used SVM in our project because SVM is better than most of the other algorithms as it has a better accuracy in results
